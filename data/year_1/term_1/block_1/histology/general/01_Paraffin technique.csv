What is the primary reason formalin is used?,It is a good dehydrating agent,It stabilizes proteins and prevents decay,It makes the tissue transparent,It is the best substance for clearing,B
After embedding a block in wax the next step is?,Staining,Clearing,Sectioning,Dehydration,C
In H&E staining what does basophilia refer to?,Affinity for acidic dyes,Affinity for basic dyes,The pink color of cytoplasm,The lack of color in lipids,B
