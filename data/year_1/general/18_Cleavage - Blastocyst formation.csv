The process from zygote to blastocyst takes about, 2 days, 4 days, 6 days, 8 days, B
The blastocyst is the stage that, Implants in the uterus, Is fertilized, Ovulates, Is shed during menstruation, A
The morula stage is characterized by, A fluid-filled cavity, No cavity, Multiple cavities, A single large cell, B
The transition from morula to blastocyst involves, Cell division only, Fluid accumulation, Cell death, Genetic recombination, B
The blastocyst is a structure, Solid, Hollow, Cystic, Tubular, B
The embryoblast is located at one pole of the, Morula, Blastocyst, Zygote, Trophoblast, B
